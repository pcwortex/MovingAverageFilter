# MovingAverageFilter
Moving Average Filter for twincat 3.1 Build 40.24.47

In order to use twincat "FB_CTRL_MOVING_AVERAGE" function block you need to use TF4100 | TwinCAT 3 Controller Toolbox which requires a license, so I created a moving average filter that works as well as Twincat's "FB_CTRL_MOVING_AVERAGE" function block.
